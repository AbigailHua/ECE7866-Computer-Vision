# How to run the code?

In file `sgm.py`, 

* Change the relative folder path in line331.

* The name of input images can be specified in line335 & 336. The default names are `img1.png` and `img2.png`.
* The projection matrices should be named as `P1.txt` and `P2.txt`. (Otherwise, modify line146 & 147.)

A new folder will be created under the relative folder path, where all intermediate results will be saved.
